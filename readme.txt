C++ Program for Student Data Management

Description
This C++ program demonstrates the use of a class to store and display student data. It takes input for a student's SAP ID, name, and GPA, and then displays the entered information.

Features
-   Defines a `Student` class with attributes for SAP ID, name, and GPA.
-   Takes user input to gather student details.
-   Displays the entered student data.

Code Structure
The code consists of the following files:
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the `Student` class.
-   `Getter and Setter.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `Student` class methods (getters and setters).
-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function that uses the `Student` class to create a student object, set its data, and display its information.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations. [cite: 8]
-   string: For using string data type. [cite: 8]

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with their respective .cpp and .h extensions (e.g., header.h, Getter and Setter.cpp, main.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
